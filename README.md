# Webpack JS starter kit
This isn't anything too crazy, just have node installed, and this should do the rest :)

Prerequisites
* Node

## Installation
If you're just starting out, go ahead and install Node.js on your system <https://nodejs.org/>.
Then install Yarn globally (because it's better than NPM... In my opinion).

In your system terminal run:
```
npm i -g yarn
```

Once yarn is installed, check that it is installed by running:
```
yarn --version
```

This template works with v1.9.4

Finally, install the dependencies by running:
```
yarn install
```

You should be good to go now!
To build the deployment project run:
```
yarn build
```

To start the dev server on port 3000 run:
```
yarn start
```

Enjoy!
